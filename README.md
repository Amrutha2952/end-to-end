This project implements a simple web application for sentiment analysis. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the sentiment of input text as either positive or negative.

The web application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. It provides a user interface where users can enter text, and the application predicts the sentiment of the text and displays the result.

Also contains a python code for showing the accuracy
